# Project 1 - *Tippy*

**Tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Mercy Bickell**

Time spent: **5-6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ X ] Improvements in UI to make the app more pleasing to eye

## Notes

I had difficulty resizing the segmented tip selector bar, but found a way to code in the resize of its height to improve user experience. Making the settings page also presented challenges, but I learned more about using Xcode in the process.
